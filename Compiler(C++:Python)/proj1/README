Project description: Evaluation and Visualization of and Expression Tree

Difficulties: First I have some problems for OO solution part, David helped me reviewed basic knowledge for how to create an OO program. Then the second part should be another alternative job, the two type of variables. I discussed with some classmates and learn the method to set up a new variable to tell the type of variable.  I learned C++ 5 years ago and almost did not use it after that, it is a difficult project for me because I spent several days to review class in c++ and google plenty of resources for the detail part of c++ class.

Extra: I think this part should be the same as difficulties.
